## Reddit Chrome Extension  


This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from the front page of [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) using RSS. This is based off of the similar extension for HackerNews [here](https://github.com/adamalbrecht/hacker-news-for-chrome)

To be released soon

#### To implement in future:

Option to toggle between old/new Reddit (easy)
Personalized post summary (moderate - probably requires looking into Reddit API)
